# Task 3
Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.

# About the data:
This is an entity-level sentiment analysis dataset of twitter. Given a message and an entity, the task is to judge the sentiment of the message about the entity. There are three classes in this dataset: Positive, Negative and Neutral. We regard messages that are not relevant to the entity (i.e. Irrelevant) as Neutral.

# Conclusion:
Analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data provided valuable insights into public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. By preprocessing the data, visualizing the results through graphs and charts, we identified trends and key drivers of sentiment. This analysis revealed how different demographic groups and time periods influence public perception, enabling better-informed decisions for marketing and brand management. Ultimately, this task underscored the importance of leveraging social media data to gain a deeper understanding of audience sentiments and to strategically shape brand communication.
